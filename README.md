# 🔐 Encrypted ATM Simulator

> 🎓 **Capstone Project – 2nd Year B.Tech (CSE)**  
> 🗓️ Developed in April-May 2025

This project is a secure desktop-based **ATM simulation system** built using **Java** and **Swing GUI**.

It simulates real-world ATM features such as:

- 🔐 AES-encrypted PIN-based login
- 💰 Balance inquiry
- 💸 Deposit & withdrawal operations
- 🧾 Mini statement (transaction history)
- 🔁 Change PIN securely

The application stores the encrypted PIN and account balance locally using **Java File I/O**, and it limits login attempts to 5 for added security.

The GUI is designed with **Java Swing**, making it simple and user-friendly.
